# Module 2 Video Script: Maximizing Deductions
**Duration: 10-12 minutes**

## Opening Hook (0:00-0:30)
**[Energetic tone]**

"What if I told you that the coffee you bought while working on a client project, the portion of your rent for your home office, and even that online course you took to improve your skills could all reduce your tax bill? Welcome to Module 2, where we're going to turn your everyday business expenses into tax savings. I'm going to show you exactly which deductions you can claim and how to do it legally and confidently."

**[On-screen text: "Turn expenses into tax savings!"]**

## Introduction (0:30-1:00)
"This is where freelancers and side hustlers have a huge advantage over regular employees. While W-2 employees have very limited deduction opportunities, you can deduct legitimate business expenses to reduce your taxable income. But here's the key: it has to be 'ordinary and necessary' for your business."

## Section 1: Home Office Deduction (1:00-3:30)

**[On-screen: Split home layout showing business vs. personal areas]**

"Let's start with the big one – the home office deduction. This can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars, but you need to do it right.

First, the space must be used EXCLUSIVELY for business. That means your kitchen table where you sometimes work doesn't count if you also eat dinner there. But a spare bedroom that's only used as your office? That's golden.

You have two options:

**The Simplified Method**: $5 per square foot up to 300 square feet. So if your home office is 200 square feet, that's a $1,000 deduction. Easy math, no receipts needed.

**The Actual Expense Method**: You deduct the actual percentage of your home expenses. If your office is 200 square feet and your home is 2,000 square feet, that's 10% of your:
- Mortgage interest or rent
- Property taxes
- Utilities
- Home insurance
- Repairs and maintenance

**[On-screen calculation example]**

Let's say your annual home expenses total $20,000. With a 10% business use, that's a $2,000 deduction – double the simplified method!

The actual expense method takes more record-keeping, but it's often worth it for larger savings."

## Section 2: Vehicle and Travel Expenses (3:30-5:30)

**[On-screen: Car with mileage tracker app]**

"If you drive for work – whether that's Uber, delivering food, or meeting clients – vehicle expenses can be your biggest deduction.

Again, you have two choices:

**Standard Mileage Rate**: For 2023, it's 65.5 cents per business mile. If you drive 10,000 business miles, that's a $6,550 deduction!

**Actual Expenses**: Track the percentage of business use and deduct that portion of:
- Gas and oil
- Repairs and maintenance
- Insurance
- Registration fees
- Depreciation

**[On-screen example]**
Sarah drives for DoorDash and puts 15,000 miles on her car annually. 12,000 are for business (80%). Her total car expenses are $8,000. Using actual expenses: $8,000 × 80% = $6,400 deduction.

But with standard mileage: 12,000 miles × $0.655 = $7,860 deduction. Standard mileage wins!

**Critical note**: You MUST track your mileage. Use an app like MileIQ or keep a simple log with date, destination, purpose, and miles."

## Section 3: Equipment and Supplies (5:30-7:00)

**[On-screen: Desk setup with computer, phone, supplies]**

"Everything you buy specifically for your business can typically be deducted:

**Technology**:
- Computer, tablet, smartphone (business portion)
- Software subscriptions
- Internet and phone bills (business percentage)
- Cloud storage

**Office Supplies**:
- Printer, paper, ink
- Pens, notebooks, folders
- Desk, chair, filing cabinet

**Industry-Specific Equipment**:
- Camera gear for photographers
- Tools for contractors
- Professional clothing (if required and not suitable for everyday wear)

**Big Purchase Tip**: For expensive equipment over $2,500, you might want to use Section 179 to deduct the full amount in the year you buy it, rather than depreciating it over several years."

## Section 4: Professional Development and Marketing (7:00-8:30)

**[On-screen: Online course interface, business cards, conference badge]**

"Investing in yourself and your business? Those costs are deductible too!

**Education and Training**:
- Online courses to improve your skills
- Professional certifications
- Industry workshops and seminars
- Books and magazines related to your field

**Marketing and Networking**:
- Website hosting and domain registration
- Business cards and brochures
- Social media advertising
- Professional headshots
- Networking event tickets

**Professional Services**:
- Accounting and bookkeeping
- Legal consultations
- Professional memberships

Real example: Jake is a freelance web developer. He spent $500 on a React course, $200 on networking events, and $300 on his professional website. That's $1,000 in deductions that directly improved his earning potential!"

## Section 5: Meals and Entertainment (8:30-9:30)

**[On-screen: Business lunch, coffee shop work session]**

"Business meals are 50% deductible, but you need a clear business purpose:

**Deductible meals**:
- Taking a client to lunch to discuss a project
- Coffee meetings with potential partners
- Meals while traveling for business

**Not deductible**:
- Your regular lunch break
- Meals with friends who aren't clients
- Personal dining out

**Pro tip**: If you're working alone at a coffee shop, that coffee isn't a business meal – but if you're meeting a client there, then 50% of both your meals are deductible!"

## Section 6: Common Mistakes to Avoid (9:30-10:30)

**[Serious, cautionary tone]**

"Here are the biggest mistakes I see:

1. **Mixing personal and business**: Your gym membership isn't deductible just because you say it keeps you healthy for work.

2. **No documentation**: 'I think I spent about...' doesn't work. Keep receipts and records.

3. **Being too aggressive**: Claiming 100% business use of your smartphone when you clearly use it personally will raise red flags.

4. **Missing legitimate deductions**: Don't leave money on the table! If it's truly for business, claim it.

Remember: You need to be able to prove every deduction with documentation."

## Conclusion and Action Steps (10:30-11:30)

"Let's recap the big ones:
- Home office: $5 per square foot simplified, or percentage of actual expenses
- Vehicle: Standard mileage rate or actual expenses
- Equipment: Deduct what you buy for business
- Professional development: Courses, books, memberships
- Business meals: 50% deductible with business purpose

Your homework: Download the deduction checklist and go through your last three months of expenses. I bet you'll find deductions you missed!

In our next module, we're covering record-keeping – because great deductions mean nothing if you can't prove them to the IRS."

## Call to Action (11:30-12:00)

"Before moving on, spend 15 minutes reviewing your recent expenses with our checklist. Start a simple spreadsheet or use an app like QuickBooks Self-Employed to track going forward.

Trust me, future tax-season you will thank present-day you for getting organized now!"
