# Home Office Deduction Calculator

## Method 1: Simplified Method (Easier)

### Requirements:
- Space used **exclusively** for business
- Maximum 300 square feet
- $5 per square foot deduction

### Calculation:
```
Business Square Footage × $5 = Deduction Amount
(Maximum 300 sq ft × $5 = $1,500 maximum deduction)
```

### Example:
- Home office size: 150 square feet
- Calculation: 150 × $5 = **$750 deduction**

## Method 2: Actual Expense Method (More Complex, Often Higher Deduction)

### Step 1: Calculate Business Use Percentage
```
Business Square Footage ÷ Total Home Square Footage = Business Use %
```

### Step 2: Multiply Business Use % by Eligible Home Expenses

| Expense Category | Annual Amount | Business Use % | Deductible Amount |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Mortgage Interest/Rent | $_________ | ____% | $_________ |
| Property Taxes | $_________ | ____% | $_________ |
| Home Insurance | $_________ | ____% | $_________ |
| Utilities (Electric) | $_________ | ____% | $_________ |
| Utilities (Gas) | $_________ | ____% | $_________ |
| Utilities (Water/Sewer) | $_________ | ____% | $_________ |
| Utilities (Trash) | $_________ | ____% | $_________ |
| General Repairs* | $_________ | ____% | $_________ |
| **TOTAL DEDUCTION** | | | **$_________** |

*General repairs that benefit the entire home (roof, HVAC, plumbing)

### Example Calculation:

**Home Details:**
- Total home size: 2,000 sq ft
- Office size: 200 sq ft
- Business use percentage: 200 ÷ 2,000 = **10%**

**Annual Home Expenses:**
| Expense | Amount | 10% Business Use | Deduction |
|---------|--------|------------------|-----------|
| Mortgage Interest | $12,000 | 10% | $1,200 |
| Property Taxes | $3,000 | 10% | $300 |
| Home Insurance | $1,200 | 10% | $120 |
| Utilities | $2,400 | 10% | $240 |
| **TOTAL** | **$18,600** | | **$1,860** |
