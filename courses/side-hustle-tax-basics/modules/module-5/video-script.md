# Module 5 Video Script: Avoiding Audits and Common Mistakes
**Duration: 12-14 minutes**

## Opening Hook (0:00-0:30)
**[Serious but reassuring tone]**

"Let's address the elephant in the room – the word that strikes fear into every freelancer's heart: AUDIT. But here's the truth: your chances of being audited are less than 1% if you know what you're doing. Today, I'm going to show you exactly how to stay in that 99% safe zone while still claiming every deduction you deserve. We'll also cover the most common mistakes that cost freelancers thousands in penalties – mistakes that are completely avoidable."

## Introduction (0:30-1:00)
"This isn't about being scared of the IRS – it's about being smart. When you understand what triggers audits and how to avoid common mistakes, you can file your taxes with confidence, claim legitimate deductions aggressively, and sleep well at night knowing you've done everything right."

## Section 1: Understanding IRS Audits (1:00-3:00)

**[On-screen: IRS building, then audit statistics]**

"First, let's demystify audits. The IRS conducts three types:

**Correspondence Audit** (75% of all audits): They mail you asking for documentation about specific items. You mail back proof. Most common and least scary.

**Office Audit** (20% of audits): You visit a local IRS office to discuss your return. Usually focused on specific issues like business expenses.

**Field Audit** (5% of audits): An agent comes to your business or home. Reserved for complex cases or high-income taxpayers.

**How are you selected?**
- Computer algorithms (DIF scores) flag unusual patterns
- Random selection (very rare)
- Related examinations (if a client gets audited, they might check you too)
- Whistleblower tips

**[On-screen graphic: Audit rates by income level]**

**Your actual audit risk as a freelancer:**
- Income under $200,000: Less than 1% chance
- Properly documented deductions: Even lower risk
- Good record-keeping: Virtually audit-proof

The key insight: Audits aren't random bad luck – they're triggered by specific red flags that we can avoid."

## Section 2: Red Flags That Trigger Audits (3:00-6:00)

**[On-screen: Warning signs and red flag icons]**

"Here are the biggest red flags that can get you selected for audit:

**Red Flag #1: Disproportionate Deductions**
If your business expenses are more than 50% of your income, that's unusual. Example: You made $30,000 but claimed $20,000 in deductions. That's a 67% expense ratio – very high.

**Red Flag #2: Excessive Home Office Claims**
Claiming 40% of your home as a business office when you're a freelance writer? Suspicious. Be realistic – most home offices are 10-15% of total home space.

**Red Flag #3: 100% Business Use Claims**
Claiming your car or phone is 100% business use looks unrealistic. Even if you're an Uber driver, you probably use your car for some personal trips.

**Red Flag #4: Round Numbers Everywhere**
Claiming exactly $500 for office supplies, $1,000 for equipment, $300 for phone bills looks like you're estimating rather than tracking actual expenses.

**Red Flag #5: Cash Business Issues**
If you're in a cash-heavy business (rideshare, delivery, services) and report very low income, that raises questions.

**[On-screen examples of suspicious vs. reasonable deductions]**

**Red Flag #6: Massive Meal Deductions**
Claiming $10,000 in business meals when you made $40,000 total income suggests you ate every meal with a client.

**How to stay safe:**
- Keep expense ratios reasonable (under 40% for most service businesses)
- Use precise numbers, not round estimates
- Document everything with receipts and business purpose
- Be conservative with high-scrutiny deductions"

## Section 3: Common Filing Mistakes (6:00-8:30)

**[On-screen: Tax return with errors highlighted]**

"Let me share the most expensive mistakes I see freelancers make:

**Mistake #1: Mismatched Income Reporting**
You received a 1099 for $5,000 but only reported $4,500 because you had expenses. Wrong! Report the full $5,000 on Schedule C, then deduct expenses separately. The IRS computer will flag the mismatch.

**Mistake #2: Mixing Personal and Business**
Claiming personal expenses as business deductions. That gym membership isn't deductible just because you say it keeps you healthy for work.

**Mistake #3: Poor Record-Keeping**
Filing based on estimates or incomplete records. When audited, you can't produce receipts or business purposes for claimed expenses.

**Mistake #4: Mathematical Errors**
Simple addition and subtraction mistakes. The IRS computer catches these and automatically adjusts your return, often triggering interest and penalties.

**Mistake #5: Wrong Forms**
Using Schedule C-EZ when you should use Schedule C, or vice versa. Not filing Schedule SE when you owe self-employment tax.

**[On-screen: Before and after examples of corrected mistakes]**

**Mistake #6: Missing Deadlines**
Late filing and payment penalties can add up quickly. The late filing penalty alone is 5% per month!

**Mistake #7: Ignoring State Requirements**
Filing federal taxes but forgetting state returns, or missing state estimated payments.

**Prevention strategy:** Use tax software that checks for common errors, or hire a professional for complex situations."

## Section 4: Documentation That Protects You (8:30-10:30)

**[On-screen: Well-organized filing system, receipts, logs]**

"If you ever face an audit, your documentation is your lifeline. Here's what you need:

**For Every Business Expense:**
- Receipt or proof of payment
- Date and amount
- Business purpose clearly documented
- Client or project name (if applicable)

**For Home Office:**
- Floor plan showing business area
- Photos proving exclusive business use
- Receipts for home expenses (if using actual method)

**For Vehicle Expenses:**
- Mileage log with date, destination, business purpose
- Receipts for vehicle expenses (if using actual method)
- Odometer readings at year start and end

**For Meals and Entertainment:**
- Receipt showing date, location, amount
- Names of people present
- Business purpose of meeting
- Note: Take a photo of the receipt and write notes on the back

**[On-screen: Example properly documented receipt]**

**Digital Documentation Tips:**
- Scan receipts immediately after purchase
- Use cloud storage for backup
- Name files descriptively: '2024-03-15_Office-Depot_Printer-Paper_$47.99_Client-ABC-Project'
- Keep both digital and physical copies of major purchases

**The Golden Rule:** If you can't explain an expense to an IRS agent with supporting documentation, don't claim it."

## Section 5: What to Do If You're Audited (10:30-12:00)

**[Calm, instructional tone]**

"If you receive an audit notice, don't panic. Here's your step-by-step action plan:

**Step 1: Read the Notice Carefully**
- Identify what specific items they're questioning
- Note the deadline for response (usually 30 days)
- Determine if it's correspondence, office, or field audit

**Step 2: Gather Documentation**
- Collect receipts and records for questioned items
- Organize chronologically and by category
- Make copies – never send originals

**Step 3: Respond Appropriately**
- For correspondence audits: Mail requested documentation with cover letter
- For office audits: Schedule appointment and bring organized records
- For field audits: Consider hiring professional representation

**Step 4: Know Your Rights**
- You can have representation present
- You can request a different auditor if needed
- You can appeal the findings
- You have the right to understand what they're looking for

**[On-screen: Taxpayer Bill of Rights summary]**

**When to Hire Professional Help:**
- Field audits (always get help)
- Complex business situations
- If you're overwhelmed or intimidated
- When potential penalties are substantial

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't ignore the notice
- Don't volunteer extra information
- Don't argue or get emotional
- Don't admit to intentional wrongdoing"

## Section 6: Prevention Strategies (12:00-13:00)

**[Confident, empowering tone]**

"The best audit defense is prevention. Here's your protection strategy:

**Be Conservative When Uncertain**
If you're not sure about a deduction, either skip it or consult a professional. The money you save in potential penalties usually outweighs the tax savings.

**Use the 'Explanation Test'**
Before claiming any deduction, ask: 'Could I easily explain this expense and its business purpose to an IRS agent?' If not, don't claim it.

**Annual Professional Review**
Even if you file yourself, consider having a professional review your return every few years, especially as your income grows.

**Stay Current on Tax Law**
Tax laws change. What was deductible last year might not be this year. Follow reputable tax news sources or work with a professional who stays current.

**Keep Impeccable Records**
Good record-keeping is your best insurance policy. It protects you from audits and makes them easy to handle if they occur."
