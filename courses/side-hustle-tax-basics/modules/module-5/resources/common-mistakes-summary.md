# Common Tax Mistakes Summary for Side Hustlers

## Critical Income Reporting Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Mismatched 1099 Reporting
**What freelancers do wrong:**
- Receive 1099-NEC for $5,000
- Report only $3,500 because they had $1,500 in expenses
- Think they can "net out" expenses against 1099 income

**✅ Correct approach:**
- Report full $5,000 from 1099-NEC on Schedule C income line
- Deduct $1,500 in expenses on Schedule C expense lines
- Net profit shows as $3,500

**Why this matters:** IRS computers automatically match 1099s to your return. Mismatches trigger immediate scrutiny.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Missing Cash Income
**What freelancers do wrong:**
- Only report income that generated 1099s
- Forget about cash payments under $600
- Don't track small payments through apps like Venmo

**✅ Correct approach:**
- Report ALL income, regardless of whether you received a 1099
- Track cash payments in your records
- Include all payment app income

**Why this matters:** Unreported income is tax evasion, even if unintentional.
