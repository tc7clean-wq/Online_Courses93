# Module 1 Video Script: Tax Basics for Side Hustlers
**Duration: 8-12 minutes**

## Opening Hook (0:00-0:30)
**[Enthusiastic tone]**

"Hey there, side hustlers! Did you know that the average gig worker pays $1,200 more in taxes than they should? That's money that could be going straight into your pocket instead of Uncle Sam's. I'm [Instructor Name], and in the next 10 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly what you need to know about taxes as a freelancer or gig worker so you can keep more of what you earn."

## Introduction (0:30-1:00)
"If you're driving for Uber, designing graphics on Fiverr, or running any kind of side business, this module is for you. We're going to cover the absolute basics you need to understand about your tax obligations. Don't worry – I'll keep this simple and practical."

## Section 1: Employee vs. Independent Contractor (1:00-3:30)

**[On-screen: Split screen showing W-2 vs 1099 forms]**

"First, let's talk about the biggest difference between being an employee and being a freelancer or gig worker.

When you're an employee, your employer takes taxes out of every paycheck. You get a W-2 form at the end of the year, and your employer has already paid half of your Social Security and Medicare taxes.

But when you're a freelancer or gig worker, you're what the IRS calls an 'independent contractor.' Instead of a W-2, you get a 1099-NEC form from each client who paid you more than $600.

Here's the big difference: Nobody is taking taxes out of your payments. That means YOU are responsible for setting aside money for taxes and paying them yourself.

**[On-screen graphic: "No automatic tax withholding = You must save for taxes"]**

And here's the kicker – you have to pay BOTH the employee AND employer portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes. This is called self-employment tax, and it's 15.3% of your net earnings.

But don't panic! This is totally manageable when you know what you're doing, and there are strategies to minimize what you owe."

## Section 2: Key Tax Forms (3:30-6:00)

**[On-screen: Show each form as mentioned]**

"Let me walk you through the main tax forms you'll encounter:

**Form 1099-NEC**: This shows how much each client paid you. You should receive one from any client who paid you $600 or more. But remember – even if you don't get a 1099, you still need to report ALL your income.

**Schedule C**: This is where you report your business income and expenses. Think of it as your business profit and loss statement. This is where the magic happens for deductions!

**Schedule SE**: This calculates your self-employment tax – that 15.3% I mentioned earlier.

**Form 1040**: Your main tax return where everything comes together.

The good news? Most tax software handles these forms automatically once you input your information."

## Section 3: Self-Employment Tax (6:00-7:30)

**[On-screen: Calculator showing 15.3% breakdown]**

"Let's talk about self-employment tax because this catches a lot of people off guard.

Self-employment tax is 15.3% of your net earnings from self-employment. It breaks down like this:
- 12.4% for Social Security
- 2.9% for Medicare

Here's an example: If you made $10,000 profit from your side hustle, your self-employment tax would be about $1,530.

But here's a little-known fact that can save you money: You get to deduct half of your self-employment tax as a business expense. So you're not actually paying the full 15.3% on your gross income."

## Section 4: Quarterly Estimated Taxes (7:30-9:00)

**[On-screen: Calendar showing quarterly dates]**

"If you expect to owe $1,000 or more in taxes, you're supposed to make quarterly estimated tax payments. The due dates are:
- January 15th (for October-December)
- April 15th (for January-March)
- June 15th (for April-May)
- September 15th (for June-August)

Yes, these dates seem random – blame the IRS!

A simple rule of thumb: Set aside 25-30% of your side hustle income for taxes. Put it in a separate savings account so you're not tempted to spend it.

Use Form 1040ES to calculate and make these payments, or use the IRS online payment system."

## Section 5: Important Deadlines (9:00-10:00)

**[On-screen: Timeline graphic]**

"Mark these dates on your calendar:

- **April 15th**: Annual tax return due (unless it falls on a weekend or holiday)
- **October 15th**: Extended filing deadline if you file for an extension
- **Quarterly payment dates**: We just covered these

Pro tip: File for an automatic extension if you need more time, but remember – an extension to file is NOT an extension to pay. You still need to pay any taxes owed by April 15th."

## Conclusion and Next Steps (10:00-11:00)
