### You're Likely an Employee If:
- ✅ Company sets your work hours
- ✅ Company provides equipment/tools
- ✅ Company trains you
- ✅ You can only work for this company
- ✅ Company controls how you do your work
- ✅ You receive benefits (health insurance, paid time off)

### You're Likely an Independent Contractor If:
- ✅ You set your own hours
- ✅ You use your own equipment
- ✅ You have multiple clients
- ✅ You control how you complete the work
- ✅ You can hire others to help you
- ✅ You invoice for your services

- **Delivery Drivers** (DoorDash, Instacart)
- **Freelance Writers**

## Tax Implications

### As an Employee:
- Taxes automatically withheld
- Employer pays half of Social Security/Medicare
- Limited business deduction opportunities
- May receive W-2 showing total wages and taxes withheld

### As an Independent Contractor:
- No automatic tax withholding
- Must pay full 15.3% self-employment tax
- Can deduct business expenses
- May receive 1099-NEC if paid $600+ by one client
- Must report ALL income, even without 1099

## What This Means for Your Taxes

### Self-Employment Tax Calculation:
```
Net Business Income × 92.35% × 15.3% = Self-Employment Tax
```

**Example:**
- Net business income: $10,000
- Subject to SE tax: $10,000 × 92.35% = $9,235
- Self-employment tax: $9,235 × 15.3% = $1,413

### Deduction Opportunity:
You can deduct half of your self-employment tax as an "above-the-line" deduction, reducing your adjusted gross income.

## Action Steps

### If You're an Independent Contractor:
1. **Set up a separate business bank account**
2. **Save 25-30% of income for taxes**
3. **Track all business expenses**
4. **Make quarterly estimated tax payments**
5. **Keep detailed records**

### If You're Misclassified:
- File Form SS-8 to request official determination
- File Form 8919 if you believe you're an employee but received a 1099
- Consult a tax professional for complex situations

## Red Flags for Misclassification

- Company requires you to work set hours at their location
- Company provides all equipment and training
- You can't work for competitors
- Company controls every aspect of how you work
- You don't invoice - they just pay you regularly
