# Module 3 Video Script: Effective Record-Keeping
**Duration: 10-12 minutes**

## Opening Hook (0:00-0:30)
**[Relatable, slightly dramatic tone]**

"Picture this: It's tax season, and you're frantically digging through shoeboxes of receipts, trying to remember if that $47 Amazon purchase was for business or personal use. Your phone is dead, you can't find your mileage log, and you just realized you threw away the receipt for that $500 client dinner. Sound familiar?

Today, we're going to set up a record-keeping system so bulletproof that next tax season, you'll be the envy of every freelancer you know."

**[On-screen text: "Never scramble for tax documents again!"]**

## Introduction (0:30-1:00)
"Good record-keeping isn't just about being organized ‚Äì it's about protecting yourself from IRS audits, maximizing your deductions, and saving hours of stress during tax season. The system I'm about to show you takes 10 minutes to set up and will save you dozens of hours later."

## Section 1: What Records to Keep and Why (1:00-2:30)

**[On-screen: Filing cabinet with clearly labeled folders]**

"The IRS has three simple requirements for business records: They must be permanent, accurate, and complete. Here's what that means in practical terms:

**Income Records** - Keep everything that shows money coming in:
- Client invoices and payments
- 1099 forms (even if you don't receive one, document the income)
- Bank deposit records
- Payment app records (PayPal, Venmo, Cash App)

**Expense Records** - For every business expense, you need:
- The receipt or proof of payment
- The date and amount
- The business purpose
- Who was involved (if it's a meal or meeting)

**Mileage Records** - For every business trip:
- Date and destination
- Business purpose
- Starting and ending odometer readings
- Total miles

**[On-screen graphic: "Receipt + Date + Purpose = Valid Deduction"]**

The golden rule: If you can't prove it, you can't deduct it. The IRS can audit you up to 3 years after filing, so keep records for at least that long ‚Äì I recommend 7 years to be safe."

## Section 2: Setting Up Your Digital System (2:30-5:00)

**[Screen recording: Setting up cloud folders]**

"Let me show you my favorite digital setup. I use a combination of cloud storage and apps, but you can adapt this to whatever tools you prefer.

**Cloud Storage Structure** (using Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar):
```
üìÅ Business Taxes 2024
  üìÅ Income
    üìÅ January
    üìÅ February
    [etc...]
  üìÅ Expenses
    üìÅ Office Supplies
    üìÅ Travel & Meals
    üìÅ Equipment
    üìÅ Marketing
  üìÅ Receipts - Photos
  üìÅ Mileage Logs
  üìÅ Tax Documents
```

**Receipt Scanning Process**:
1. Take a photo immediately after purchase
2. Use an app like CamScanner or your phone's built-in scanner
3. Save with a descriptive filename: "2024-03-15_Office-Depot_Printer-Paper_$47.99"
4. Upload to the appropriate expense folder

**[Demo: Phone app scanning a receipt]**

**Pro tip**: Email receipts are golden! Always choose the email receipt option when shopping. Create a dedicated email folder called 'Business Receipts' and set up automatic forwarding from purchase confirmations."

## Section 3: Expense Tracking Made Simple (5:00-7:00)

**[On-screen: Spreadsheet template demonstration]**

"You don't need fancy software ‚Äì a simple spreadsheet works perfectly. Here's my template:

| Date | Vendor | Amount | Category | Business Purpose | Receipt? |
|------|--------|--------|----------|------------------|----------|
| 3/15/24 | Office Depot | $47.99 | Office Supplies | Printer paper for client proposals | ‚úì |
| 3/16/24 | Starbucks | $12.50 | Meals (50%) | Meeting with potential client Sarah | ‚úì |

**Key columns explained**:
- **Date**: When you made the purchase
- **Vendor**: Where you bought it
- **Amount**: Total cost
- **Category**: Matches your deduction categories
- **Business Purpose**: Why this was a business expense
- **Receipt**: Checkmark if you have documentation

**Monthly routine**: Spend 30 minutes at month-end categorizing expenses. This prevents the year-end scramble and helps you track spending patterns.

**Mixed personal/business expenses**: For things like your phone bill or car expenses, note the business percentage. If your phone is 70% business, note that in the purpose column."

## Section 4: Mileage Tracking That Actually Works (7:00-8:30)

**[Screen recording: Mileage tracking app]**

"Mileage is usually your biggest deduction, but it's also the most scrutinized by the IRS. Here's how to do it right:

**Automatic tracking apps** (MileIQ, Everlance, QuickBooks Self-Employed):
- Automatically track all trips using GPS
- Classify trips as business or personal
- Generate IRS-compliant reports
- Cost: $5-15/month, but often pays for itself

**Manual tracking** (if you prefer old-school):
- Keep a small notebook in your car
- Record: Date, starting location, destination, business purpose, miles
- Take a photo of your odometer at the beginning and end of the year

**[On-screen: Manual log example]**
Date: 3/15/24
From: Home (123 Main St)
To: Client office (456 Business Ave)
Purpose: Project meeting with ABC Corp
Miles: 12.7

**Don't forget**: Parking fees and tolls for business trips are also deductible!"

## Section 5: Physical Document Organization (8:30-9:30)

**[On-screen: Organized file cabinet]**

"Even in our digital world, some documents are better kept in physical form, especially anything you might need to produce quickly:

**Essential physical files**:
- Original tax returns
- Legal documents (contracts, business licenses)
- Important receipts for major purchases
- Bank statements

**Simple filing system**:
- One folder per month for current year receipts
- Separate folders for different expense categories
- Year-end box for completed tax years
- Keep business and personal documents completely separate

**Backup strategy**:
- Scan important physical documents to cloud storage
- Keep copies of critical files in a safe deposit box
- Have both digital and physical backups of tax returns"

## Section 6: Red Flags and Best Practices (9:30-10:30)

**[Serious, advisory tone]**

"Let me share some red flags that can trigger audits and how to avoid them:

**Red flags**:
- Round numbers (claiming exactly $500 for office supplies looks suspicious)
- Excessive meal deductions compared to income
- 100% business use claims for cars or phones
- Claiming the same deduction multiple times

**Best practices**:
- Be precise with amounts ($487.63, not $500)
- Keep business and personal expenses completely separate
- Document everything, even small purchases
- When in doubt, be conservative
- Never guess ‚Äì if you don't have the receipt, don't claim it

**Golden rule**: Could you explain this expense to an IRS agent? If not, don't claim it."

## Conclusion and Action Steps (10:30-11:30)

"Let's recap your action plan:
1. Set up your digital filing system today
2. Download the expense tracking template
3. Choose a mileage tracking method
4. Establish a monthly review routine
5. Create physical backup system for important documents

The 10 minutes you spend setting this up will save you hours of stress and potentially thousands in missed deductions.

In our next module, we're covering the actual filing process ‚Äì but with your records this organized, it's going to be a breeze!"

## Call to Action (11:30-12:00)

"Your homework: Spend the next hour setting up your record-keeping system. Download all the templates, create your folders, and input this month's expenses.

Trust me, your future self will send you a thank-you card come tax season!"
