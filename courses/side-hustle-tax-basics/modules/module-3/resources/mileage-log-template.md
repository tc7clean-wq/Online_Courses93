## Common Business Trip Types

### Deductible Business Trips:
- ✅ Client meetings and site visits
- ✅ Picking up business supplies
- ✅ Bank visits for business banking
- ✅ Post office for business mail
- ✅ Networking events and conferences
- ✅ Equipment purchases
- ✅ Business-related errands

---

## Trip Purpose Examples

- "Client presentation meeting at ABC Corp"
- "Purchase printer supplies for business at Office Depot"
- "Bank deposit of client payments at Wells Fargo"
- "Networking event at Chamber of Commerce"
- "Pick up materials for Johnson project"

- "Shopping" (for what business purpose?)
- "Appointment" (business or personal?)

## Year-End Calculations

### 2024 Standard Mileage Rates:
- **Business**: $0.655 per mile
- **Medical/Moving**: $0.22 per mile
- **Charitable**: $0.14 per mile

### Calculation Example:
```
Total Business Miles: 12,750
Standard Mileage Rate: $0.655
Total Deduction: 12,750 × $0.655 = $8,351.25
```

### Alternative: Actual Vehicle Expenses
Instead of standard mileage, you can deduct actual expenses:
- Gas and oil
- Repairs and maintenance
- Insurance
- Registration and license fees
- Depreciation

**Business Use Percentage** = Business Miles ÷ Total Miles

Example: If you drove 12,750 business miles out of 18,000 total miles, your business use is 70.8%

### Documentation to Keep:
- Detailed mileage logs (paper or digital)
- Calendars showing business appointments
- Receipts for vehicle expenses (if using actual method)

### Best Practices:

**Remember**: The IRS requires "contemporaneous" records, meaning you should log trips when they occur, not reconstruct them months later.
